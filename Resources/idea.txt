two scenes

/////////
//WORLD 1
/////////
?
How to get to scene 2?

GENRE:
------
shmup
platformer(no)
something completely different
puzzle?

/////////
//WORLD 2
/////////
move between worlds
worlds are parallel?
kill something in world 1,
spawn something in world 2?
(worlds not different scenes,
 just two worlds and a switch?)
(tactical?)
(gain & lose powers?)
(transform?)

*you can only stay for (5?) seconds in world 2
 -> you die if you break this rule
*moving objects that kill you in world 1 (that keep on moving while you are in world 2!)

no genre, just extension to scene 1

(tiny)SCOPE IS IMPORTANT!!!

//////////
//////////
real deal
//////////
//////////

Two worlds:
World 1
-------
[] "bogeys" that will kill you on collision
[x] "bogeys" will keep on moving on their predestined paths during your stay in World 2

World 2
-------
[] "dreamlike world"
[] looks like world 1 but maybe a different tint
[] no moving things
[] you have a gun that you can shoot
[] you only get to stay for (5) seconds each visit
[] powerups(speed, extra life)
[] you always come back to the same spot in world 1
